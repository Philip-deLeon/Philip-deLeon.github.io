**League of Legends (LoL)** is a multiplayer online battle arena (*MOBA*) game developed and published by **Riot Games**. Released in **2009**, it has since become one of the most popular and influential esports titles in the world, known for its competitive gameplay, lore, and large playerbase.


## Past
Originally inspired by the **Defense of the Ancients** (DotA), a mod for **Warcraft III**, **League of Legends** was developed by a group of passionate designers who wanted to create a standalone game built around the team-based strategy and skill expression the **DotA** mod introduced. Once released, it featured a limited number of **champions** (*playable characters*) and a single primary game mode, but it quickly gained traction due to its accessibility and frequent updates.

## Present
Today, League of Legends boasts over **160 champions**, a global esports scene, and numerous spin-offs in different genres, including **Legends of Runeterra** (a card game) and Teamfight Tactics (an auto-battler). Riot Games continues to expand the Runeterra universe through cinematics, music, and the critically acclaimed Netflix series Arcane.
### Esports

### Community
The player community remains active across forums, Twitch streams, and social media. While the game has faced challenges with toxicity and balancing, Riot has implemented systems to encourage positive behavior and fair play.
